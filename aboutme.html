        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm [Kapil Chauhan], a passionate and detail-oriented web developer based in [Your City, Country]. 
            With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy creating responsive and user-friendly websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into the world of coding started with a curiosity for problem-solving, and it has grown into a 
            love for building digital experiences. I am constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay 
            updated with the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring outdoor activities, reading about the latest tech trends, 
            or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I believe in the power of continuous learning and 
            collaboration to create meaningful and impactful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's connect and embark on exciting projects together! Feel free to reach out via [kapilchauhan7823@email.com] or 
            connect with me on [LinkedIn/GitHub].
